# clp
Create a function to find the Common Lowest Parent of two nodes from a Binary balanced tree.
With the special condition, that alwys the the nodes that we search always are present in the tree.

* For the tree implementation used AVL tree borrowed from  http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/
* Used 32-bit linux with gcc and gnu make for the implementation environment
* To build the code use `make` in the project's directory
* To run the tests use `./test` in the project's directory
